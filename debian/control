Description: font with a glyph for each visible Unicode 5.1 Plane 0 character
 This package is a convenient way to install both the PCF bitmap
 version and the scalable TrueType outline version of GNU Unifont.
 It also installs a copy of unifont.hex and related files in
 /usr/share/unifont.
 .
 GNU Unifont was designed to render something besides an empty box
 for each visible Unicode character in the Basic Multilingual Plane
 (Plane 0).  Plane 0 contains most of the world's modern writing scripts.
 This font looks best at 12pt.
 .
 Complex fonts (such as Indic or Semitic scripts, where letters
 change shape depending on their position in a word, or such as
 Mongolian, which is written vertically) will not render perfectly.
 The philosophy behind this font, though, is that anything meaningful
 is better than an empty box for a unknown glyph.

Description: PCF (bitmap) version of the GNU Unifont
 This is a bitmap font in a standard X11 format.  The font provides
 a glyph for each visible code point (character) in the Unicode Basic
 Multilingual Plane (Plane 0).  Plane 0 contains most of the world's
 modern writing scripts.  This font looks best at 12pt.
 .
 Complex fonts (such as Indic or Semitic scripts, where letters
 change shape depending on their position in a word, or such as
 Mongolian, which is written vertically) will not render perfectly.
 The philosophy behind this font, though, is that anything meaningful
 is better than an empty box for a unknown glyph.
 .
 Consider using the TrueType version instead (ttf-unifont), because
 that version is scalable to any point size.

Package: ttf-unifont
Architecture: all
Description: TrueType version of the GNU Unifont
 This is a bitmap font converted into a scalable TrueType outline
 font.  Each pixel in the original bitmap font is represented as
 an outlined square.  The font provides a glyph for each visible
 code point (character) in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane
 (Plane 0).  Plane 0 contains most of the world's modern writing
 scripts.  This font looks best at 12pt.

Description: utilities for manipulating the GNU Unifont
 This is a set of Perl scripts, C programs, and FontForge scripts
 to manipulate Roman Czyborra's GNU Unifont ".hex" format font
 files.  The GNU Unifont has a Unicode-compatible font structure.
 These utilities allow editing ".hex" fonts with text and
 graphical editors, producing final versions of fonts in BDF,
 PCF, TrueType SBIT, and TrueType outline formats.
 .
 To build the TrueType fonts, install the package 'fontforge'.
 To build the PCF fonts, use 'bdftopcf', which is in the
 'xfonts-utils' package.  To obtain the font sources, run
 'apt-get source unifont'.
