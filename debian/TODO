* Determine optimal X-FontName for debian/ttf-unifont.defoma-hints.
  In particular, determine if huge TrueType fonts must still be listed
  as charcell ("-c-") or if they can be listed as proportional ("-p-")
  without incurring a huge penalty from rasterizing the entire font
  upon loading:

       X-FontName = -gnu-unifont-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso10646-1
