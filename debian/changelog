unifont (1:1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct Build-Depends, closes: #134431
  * New Upstream (dvdeug) and -release. Note that I did *not* change
    the font's name or split it in two like the replacement upstream did.
    Please mail if you think it's a good idea to do the split anyway
    (and break compatibility).
  * Integrated Ruchira Datta's Bengali glyphs, closes: #69896
