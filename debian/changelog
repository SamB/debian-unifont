unifont (1:5.1.20080914-1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * debian/rules: Split and inline "install" target into "binary-arch" and
    "binary-indep" and adjust dependencies.  (Without this,
    "dpkg-buildpackage -B" ends up running the build-indep rules and dying
    on the buildds.)
  * debian/rules: Also fix so dpkg-buildpackage -j works, and only builds
    the font files once.

unifont (1:5.1.20080914-1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Samuel Bronson ]
  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Actually build the font files, using build-arch and build-indep to
    avoid killing any buildds. (Closes: #697902)
  * Don't include bogus glyphs for unallocated (as of Unicode 5.1) or
    private-use characters. (Closes: #584672)

  [ Paul Wise ]
  * Place the newly compiled fonts in precompiled dir after build.

unifont (1:5.1.20080914-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed unifont.ttf location in defoma-hints file. (Closes: #498874)
  * Modified src/hex2sfd to superimpose combining diacritical marks on
    top of preceding glyphs in TrueType font as per the Unicode Standard.
    (Closes: #497326)
  * Modified "cp -a" ==> "cp -p" and eliminated "install -t" in Makefiles
    for BSD Unix compatibility.
  * Renamed "combining.txt" to "combining.dat" because it is a data file.
  * Generated new font/precompiled/unifont.ttf font from the above changes.

unifont (1:5.1.20080820-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replaced Hangul Syllables block with glyphs in unifont.bdf file
    in Debian bf-utf-source package, originally from the Debian
    xfonts-baekmuk package (Closes: #495729)
    - Avoids license ambiguity of unifont's original Hanterm fonts
    - Brings two diverging Debian copies of the unifont font closer together
  * Deleted references to and all derivative copies of any Hanterm fonts
  * Changed unifont package description in debian/control to mention
    that the package now installs /usr/share/unifont/unifont.hex and
    other files and is no longer just a metapackage (Closes: #494662)

unifont (1:5.1.20080808-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Install unifont.hex [and other files while I was at it] in
    /usr/share/unifont for GRUB (Closes: #494473)
    - unifont.hex provides glyphs with no combining circles, etc. and
      is the same file as font/compiled/unifont-5.1.20080808.hex
    - unifontfull.hex provides glyphs with combining circles, etc. and
      is the same file as font/compiled/unifontfull-5.1.20080808.hex.
      If editing hex glyphs, this file is the master version to edit;
      unifont.hex is generated from this full version -- see uniunmask(1)
      for details.
    - combining.txt lists all Unicode 5.1 code points that are combining
      glyphs, and hence should have zero-width.
    - README gives a brief description of the above three files
  * Corrected typos in the previous changelog entry.

unifont (1:5.1.20080808-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added needed Replaces, Conflicts lines in debian/control (Closes: #493711)
  * Added "Build-Depends-Indep: defoma" line in debian/control for access
    to dh_installdefoma to install TrueType font (Closes: #494245)
  * Changed ttf-unifont.defoma-hints file entry for "GeneralFamily"
    from "SansSerif" to "Typewriter" as a better match
  * Changed dh_lintian lines in debian/rules to use "( ... ) || /bin/true"
    so debuild would succeed on a generic Etch DVD installation that
    doesn't include dh_lintian in the debhelper package
  * Added updates from Ubuntu unifont package:
    - hex2bdf now uses additional BDF header lines for better font
      description
    - hex2bdf-split (originally Dave Starner's adaptation of Roman
      Czyborra's hex2bdf) renamed from hex2bdf.  Use is discouraged
      but it's still here for now for completeness; wrote man page
      & changed name of output font from "-gnu-fixed-*" to "-gnu-unifont-*"
    - Added Georgian glyphs contributed to Ubuntu's unifont package by
      Gia Shervashidze and Vladimer Sichinava
  * Merged man page & Makefile changes done by Anthony Fok from Debian
    diff file into .orig.tar.gz
  * Made minor changes to existing programs in ./src
    - unibmp2hex.c: forced double-wide glyphs where appropriate in
      U+FFxx range
    - uniunmask.c: increased buffer size & hard-coded "wide" variable
      to avoid accidentally invoking a half-implemented extended
      character widths
    - unihex2bmp.c: same changes as in uniunmask.c
  * Added to existing documentation
    - Updated "./README" to reflect changes to Makefiles and add
      more information
    - Added "./font/hexsrc/README" to describe how to use all files
      in that directory to create a font
    - Added full font embedding exception to GPL from Wen Quan Yi
  * Added improved glyphs for the U+FF00..U+FFFF block
  * Removed "./font/hexsrc/blanks-5.1.hex"; it was identical to
    "blanks.hex" in the same directory and the Makefiles never used it.
