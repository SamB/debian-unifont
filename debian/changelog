unifont (1:5.1.20080808-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added needed Replaces, Conflicts lines in debian/control (Closes: #493711)
  * Added "Build-Depends-Indep: defoma" line in debian/control for access
    to dh_installdefoma to install TrueType font (Closes: #494245)
  * Changed ttf-unifont.defoma-hints file entry for "GeneralFamily"
    from "SansSerif" to "Typewriter" as a better match
  * Changed dh_lintian lines in debian/rules to use "( ... ) || /bin/true"
    so debuild would succeed on a generic Etch DVD installation that
    doesn't include dh_lintian in the debhelper package
  * Added updates from Ubuntu unifont package:
    - hex2bdf now uses additional BDF header lines for better font
      description
    - hex2bdf-split (originally Dave Starner's adaption of Roman
      Czyborra's hex2bdf) renamed from hex2bdf.  Use is discouraged
      but it's still here for now for completeness); wrote man page
      & changed name of output font from "-gnu-fixed-*" to "-gnu-unifont-*"
    - Added Georgian glyphs contributed to Ubuntu's unifont package by
      Gia Shervashidze and Vladimer Sichinava
  * Merged man page & Makefile changes done by Anthony Fok from Debian
    diff file into .orig.tar.gz
  * Made minor changes to existing programs in ./src
    - unibmp2hex.c: forced double-wide glyphs where appropriate in
      U+FFxx range
    - uniunmask.c: increased buffer size & hard-coded "wide" variable
      to avoid accidentally invoking a half-implemented extended
      character widths
    - unihex2bmp.c: same changes as in uniunmask.c
  * Added to existing documentation
    - Updated "./README" to reflect changes to Makefiles and add
      more information
    - Added "./font/hexsrc/README" to describe how to use all files
      in that directory to create a font
    - Added full font embedding exception to GPL from Wen Quan Yi
  * Added improved glyphs for the U+FF00..U+FFFF block
  * Removed "./font/hexsrc/blanks-5.1.hex"; it was identical to
    "blanks.hex" in the same directory and the Makefiles never used it.

unifont (1:1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct Build-Depends, closes: #134431
  * New Upstream (dvdeug) and -release. Note that I did *not* change
