.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-ppagenum
Just print information on one 256 code point "page" rather than
the entire Basic Multilingual Plane.  This prints a 16 by 16 table with
an asterisk in every code point that has an assigned glyph.
.TP
-h
Print an HTML table with color-coded cell background colors
instead of a plain text table.
.TP
-l
[The letter "l" ]: Print hyperlink to font bitmaps in the HTML table.
To create the bitmaps themselves, use the unihex2bmp program.
The bitmaps are assumed to be in the directory "bmp/".

extensive error checking on its input files.  If they're not in the
format of the original GNU Unifont hex file, all bets are off.
