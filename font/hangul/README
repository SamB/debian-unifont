Because Debian GNU/Linux applications no longer install BDF fonts,
this directory contains gzipped BDF fonts used at one point with
Hanterm and later with Red Hat Korea, Korean FreeBSD, Mozilla
Firefox, and other software/distributions, released under the GPL.

With hanterm.org no longer online as of this writing, he most
up-to-date sources are mentioned at

     http://www.kr.freebsd.org/ml/hangul-patch/2001/12/msg00003.html

To use the fonts, first uncompress them with a command of the form

     gunzip file.gz

The johab2ucs2 script in this package reads these four BDF fonts
and outputs the entire block of Unicode Hangul Syllables using the
input font to form the syllables.

For a detailed description of the structure of the four BDF fonts
in this directory, see
